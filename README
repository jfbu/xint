Installation and Usage:
=======================

Run tex or latex on xint.dtx.
 
This will extract the style files xint.sty, xintgcd.sty, xintfrac.sty,
xintseries.sty, xintcfrac.sty (and xint.ins). Files with the same
names and in the same repertory will be overwritten. The tex (not
latex) run will stop with the complaint that it does not understand
\NeedsTeXFormat, but the style files will already have been extracted
by that time.

Alternatively, run tex or latex on xint.ins if available.

To get xint.pdf run pdflatex thrice on xint.dtx

           xint.sty |
        xintgcd.sty |
       xintfrac.sty | --> TDS:tex/generic/xint/
     xintseries.sty |
      xintcfrac.sty |
           xint.dtx   --> TDS:source/generic/xint/
           xint.pdf   --> TDS:doc/generic/xint/
 
 It may be necessary to then refresh the TeX installation filename
 database.

Usage with LaTeX: \usepackage{xint}
                  \usepackage{xintgcd}     (loads xint)
                  \usepackage{xintfrac}    (loads xint)
                  \usepackage{xintseries}  (loads xintfrac)
                  \usepackage{xintcfrac}   (loads xintfrac)

Usage with TeX:   \input xint.sty\relax   
                  \input xintgcd.sty\relax     (loads xint)
                  \input xintfrac.sty\relax    (loads xint)
                  \input xintseries.sty\relax  (loads xintfrac)
                  \input xintcfrac.sty\relax   (loads xintfrac)
