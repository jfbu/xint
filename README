Style files which will self-extract from xint.dtx:
       xinttools.sty  Expandable and non-expandable utilities
       xint.sty       Expandable operations on long numbers
       xintfrac.sty   Expandable operations on fractions
       xintexpr.sty   Expandable expression parser
       xintbinhex.sty Expandable binary and hexadecimal conversions
       xintgcd.sty    Euclidean algorithm with xint package
       xintseries.sty Expandable partial sums with xint package
       xintcfrac.sty  Expandable continued fractions with xint package

All these files should go into TDS:tex/generic/xint/
(see detailed installation instructions below)

May be used with Plain TeX (\input) or as LaTeX packages (\usepackage)

Abstract
========

xinttools is loaded by xint (hence by all other packages of the
bundle, too): it provides utilities of independent interest such as
expandable and non-expandable loops.

xint implements with expandable TEX macros additions, subtractions,
multiplications, divisions and powers with arbitrarily long numbers.

xintfrac extends the scope of xint to decimal numbers, to numbers in
scientific notation and also to fractions with arbitrarily long such
numerators and denominators separated by a forward slash.

xintexpr extends xintfrac with an expandable parser 
         \xintexpr . . . \relax
of expressions involving arithmetic operations in infix notation on
decimal numbers, fractions, numbers in scientific notation, with
parentheses, factorial symbol, function names, comparison operators,
logic operators, twofold and threefold way conditionals,
sub-expressions, macros expanding to the previous items.

Further modules:

xintbinhex is for conversions to and from binary and hexadecimal
bases.

xintseries provides some basic functionality for computing in an
expandable manner partial sums of series and power series with
fractional coefficients.

xintgcd implements the Euclidean algorithm and its typesetting.

xintcfrac deals with the computation of continued fractions.

Most macros, and all of those doing computations, work purely by
expansion without assignments, and may thus be used almost everywhere
in TeX. The packages may be used with any flavor of TeX supporting the
e-TeX extensions. LaTeX users will use \usepackage and others \input
to load the package components.


Installation and Usage:
=======================

If xint.ins is available "tex xint.ins" generates the style files
(pre-existing files in the same repertory will be overwritten).

Else, either "latex xint.dtx" or "pdflatex xint.dtx" or "tex xint.dtx"
will also generate the style files (and the xint.ins file). The tex
run stops (contrarily to latex/pdflatex) with the complaint that it
does not understand \NeedsTeXFormat, but the style files will already
have been extracted by that time.

To get xint.pdf run pdflatex thrice on xint.dtx

      xinttools.sty |
           xint.sty |
       xintfrac.sty |
       xintexpr.sty | --> TDS:tex/generic/xint/ 
     xintbinhex.sty |
        xintgcd.sty |
     xintseries.sty |
      xintcfrac.sty |
           xint.dtx   --> TDS:source/generic/xint/
           xint.pdf   --> TDS:doc/generic/xint/

It may be necessary to then refresh the TeX installation filename
database.

Usage with LaTeX: \usepackage{xinttools}
                  \usepackage{xint}       % (loads xinttools)
                  \usepackage{xintfrac}   % (loads xint)
                  \usepackage{xintexpr}   % (loads xintfrac)

                  \usepackage{xintbinhex} % (loads xint)
                  \usepackage{xintgcd}    % (loads xint)
                  \usepackage{xintseries} % (loads xintfrac)
                  \usepackage{xintcfrac}  % (loads xintfrac)

Usage with TeX:   \input xinttools.sty\relax   
                  \input xint.sty\relax       % (loads xinttools)
                  \input xintfrac.sty\relax   % (loads xint)
                  \input xintexpr.sty\relax   % (loads xintfrac)

                  \input xintbinhex.sty\relax % (loads xint)
                  \input xintgcd.sty\relax    % (loads xint)
                  \input xintseries.sty\relax % (loads xintfrac)
                  \input xintcfrac.sty\relax  % (loads xintfrac)
