Installation and Usage:
=======================

Run tex or latex on xint.dtx.

This will extract the style files xint.sty, xintfrac.sty, xintexpr.sty,
xintbinhex.sty, xintgcd.sty, xintseries.sty, xintcfrac.sty (and xint.ins).

Files with the same names and in the same repertory will be overwritten.
The tex (not latex) run will stop with the complaint that it does not
understand \NeedsTeXFormat, but the style files will already have been
extracted by that time.

Alternatively, run tex or latex on xint.ins if available.

To get xint.pdf run pdflatex thrice on xint.dtx

           xint.sty |
       xintfrac.sty |
       xintexpr.sty |
     xintbinhex.sty | --> TDS:tex/generic/xint/
        xintgcd.sty |
     xintseries.sty |
      xintcfrac.sty |
           xint.dtx   --> TDS:source/generic/xint/
           xint.pdf   --> TDS:doc/generic/xint/

It may be necessary to then refresh the TeX installation filename
database.
