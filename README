This README is also available as README.pdf and README.html.

Change log is in CHANGES.pdf and CHANGES.html.



USAGE


With LaTeX

    \usepackage{xint}       % expandable arithmetic with big integers
    \usepackage{xintfrac}   % decimal numbers, fractions, floats
    \usepackage{xintexpr}   % expressions with infix operators

Further packages: xintbinhex, xintgcd, xintseries and xintcfrac. All
dependencies are handled automatically. For example xintexpr
automatically loads xintfrac which itself loads xint. Package xintcore
is the subset of xint providing only the five operations on big
integers: \xintiiAdd, \xintiiMul,Â ... There is also xinttools which is a
separate package providing, among others, expandable and non-expandable
loops such as \xintFor.


With TeX

One does for example:

    \input xintexpr.sty\relax

Again, all dependencies are handled automatically. The packages may be
loaded in any catcode context such that letters, digits, \ and % have
their standard catcodes.

xintcore.sty and xinttools.sty both import xintkernel.sty which has the
catcode handler and package identifier and defines a few utilities such
as \oodef or \xint_dothis/\xint_orthat.



INSTALLATION


Method A: using the package manager of your TeX distribution

xint is included in TeXLive (hence also MacTeX) and MikTeX.

There can be a few days of delay between apparition of a new version on
CTAN and availability via the distribution package manager.


Method B: manual installation using xint.tds.zip and unzip

Assumes a GNU/Linux-like system (or Mac OS X).

1.  obtain xint.tds.zip from CTAN:
    http://mirror.ctan.org/install/macros/generic/xint.tds.zip

2.  cd to the download repertory and issue:

        unzip xint.tds.zip -d <TEXMF>

    where <TEXMF> is a suitable TDS-compliant destination repertory. For
    example, with TeXLive:

    -   Linux, standard access rights, hence sudo is needed,
        installation into the "local" tree:

            sudo unzip xint.tds.zip -d /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
            sudo texhash /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

    -   Mac OS X, installation into user home folder (no sudo needed,
        and it is recommended to not have a ls-R file there, hence no
        texhash):

            unzip xint.tds.zip -d  ~/Library/texmf


Method C: manual installation using Makefile and xint.dtx

The Makefile automatizes rebuilding from xint.dtx all documentation
files as well as xint.tds.zip. It is for GNU/Linux-like (inc. Mac OS X)
systems, with a teTeX like installation such as TeXLive. Furthermore the
Pandoc software is required.

1.  obtain xint.dtx and Makefile from http://www.ctan.org/pkg/xint.

2.  put them in an otherwise empty working repertory, run make or
    equivalently make help for further instructions.


Method D: installation starting with only xint.dtx

Run "tex xint.dtx" or "etex xint.dtx" to extract from xint.dtx all
packages as well as these files:

README.md
    the current README with Markdown formatting.

CHANGES.md
    the changes across successive releases.

xint.tex

    used to generate xint.pdf via "latex xint.tex" (thrice) then
    "dvipdfmx xint.dvi". For successful compilation, packages newtxtt,
    newtxmath, etoc, mathastext are needed. Inclusion of the source code
    is off by default, but the toggle can be set in xint.tex.

    It is also possible to compile xint.tex with pdflatex.

    A third option is to generate xint.pdf via pdflatex xint.dtx. Source
    code is then included by default.

Makefile.mk
    this is for UNIX-like systems. Note: this file is only produced with
    "etex xint.dtx", not with "tex xint.dtx". Rename it to Makefile and
    run make on the command line for further help.

doHTMLs.sh and doPDFs.sh
    these are scripts (for UNIX-like systems) which can be used to
    convert the README.md and CHANGES.md to HTML and PDF formats. They
    require Pandoc.

pandoctpl.latex
    a Pandoc template used by doPDFs.sh.

Finishing the installation in a TDS hierarchy:

-   move the style files to TDS:tex/generic/xint/

-   xint.dtx goes to TDS:source/generic/xint/

-   the documentation (xint.pdf, README.md,...) goes to
    TDS:doc/generic/xint/

Depending on the destination, it may then be necessary to refresh a
filename database.
