AIM


The basic aim is provide _expandable_ computations on integers,
fractions, and floating point numbers. For example

    \xinttheexpr reduce(37189719/183618963+11390170/17310720)^17\relax

will evaluate exactly the fraction; the result has 462 characters
(including the fraction slash.) One can also work with dummy variables:

    \xinttheexpr mul(add(x(x+1)(x+2), x=y..y+15), y=171286,98762,9296)\relax

evaluates to 15979066346135829902328007959448563667099190784.

Float computations are possible at an adjustable precision (default 16).

    \xintDigits:=48;\xintthefloatexpr 123_456_789^1_000.5\relax
    ->3.63692761822782679930738270515740797370813691938e8095

But currently, only integer and half-integer exponents are allowed for
the power operation in expressions and only the square-root operation is
implemented besides the four arithmetic operations. Square-root and the
four operations achieve correct rounding in the given arbitrary
precision.

Sub-units xintcore, xint and xintfrac provide the underlying macros, and
xintexpr loads all of them and provides expandable parsers allowing
computations such as the above (and more).



USAGE


It is possible to use the package with Plain (via \input anywhere) or
with LaTeX (via \usepackage in the preamble).


With LaTeX

    \usepackage{xint}       % expandable arithmetic with big integers
    \usepackage{xintfrac}   % decimal numbers, fractions, floats
    \usepackage{xintexpr}   % expressions with infix operators

Further packages: xintbinhex, xintgcd, xintseries and xintcfrac.

Main dependencies are handled automatically. For example xintexpr
automatically loads xintfrac which itself loads xint; but use of the gcd
and lcm functions in expressions require explicit loading of xintgcd,
and hexadecimal notation requires explicit loading of xintbinhex.

Package xintcore is the subset of xint providing only the five
operations on big integers: \xintiiAdd, \xintiiMul, ... It is (by
default) loaded by the (LaTeX only) package bnumexpr which provides a
more light-weight expression parser handling only big integers, the four
operations, the power operation and the factorial.

There is also xinttools which is a separate package providing, among
others, expandable and non-expandable loops such as \xintFor.


With TeX

One does for example:

    \input xintexpr.sty

The packages may be loaded in any catcode context such that letters,
digits, \ and % have their standard catcodes.

xintcore.sty and xinttools.sty both import xintkernel.sty which has the
catcode handler and package identifier and defines a few utilities such
as \oodef, \fdef, or \xint_dothis/\xint_orthat.



INSTALLATION


Method A: using the package manager of your TeX distribution

xint is included in TeXLive (hence also MacTeX) and MikTeX.

There can be a few days of delay between apparition of a new version on
CTAN and availability via the distribution package manager.


Method B: manual installation using xint.tds.zip and unzip

Assumes a GNU/Linux-like system (or Mac OS X).

1.  obtain xint.tds.zip from CTAN:
    http://mirror.ctan.org/install/macros/generic/xint.tds.zip

2.  cd to the download repertory and issue:

        unzip xint.tds.zip -d <TEXMF>

    where <TEXMF> is a suitable TDS-compliant destination repertory. For
    example, with TeXLive:

    -   Linux, standard access rights, hence sudo is needed,
        installation into the "local" tree:

            sudo unzip xint.tds.zip -d /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
            sudo texhash /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

    -   Mac OS X, installation into user home folder (no sudo needed,
        and it is recommended to not have a ls-R file there, hence no
        texhash):

            unzip xint.tds.zip -d  ~/Library/texmf


Method C: manual installation using Makefile and xint.dtx

The Makefile automatizes rebuilding from xint.dtx all documentation
files as well as xint.tds.zip. It is for GNU/Linux-like (inc. Mac OS X)
systems, with a teTeX like installation such as TeXLive. Furthermore the
Pandoc software is required.

1.  obtain xint.dtx and Makefile from
    http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/generic/xint.

2.  put them in an otherwise empty working repertory, run make or
    equivalently make help for further instructions.


Method D: installation starting with only xint.dtx

Run "tex xint.dtx" or "etex xint.dtx" to extract from xint.dtx all
packages as well as these files:

README.md
    the current README with Markdown formatting.

CHANGES.md
    the changes across successive releases.

xint.tex
    used to generate xint.pdf via "latex xint.tex" (thrice) then
    "dvipdfmx xint.dvi". It is also possible to compile xint.tex with
    xelatex, or with pdflatex (this latter option produces a
    bigger pdf).
    For successful compilation, packages newtxtt, newtxmath, etoc,
    mathastext are needed. Inclusion of the source code is off by
    default, but the toggle can be set in xint.tex.

    A third option is to generate xint.pdf via xelatex xint.dtx or
    pdflatex xint.dtx. Source code is then included by default (but some
    code comments in French use 8bit characters, hence for xelatex an a
    priori conversion of xint.dtx into utf-8 will give a better result).

Makefile.mk
    this is for UNIX-like systems. Note: this file is only produced with
    "etex xint.dtx", not with "tex xint.dtx". Rename it to Makefile and
    run make on the command line for further help.

doHTMLs.sh and doPDFs.sh
    these are scripts (for UNIX-like systems) which can be used to
    convert the README.md and CHANGES.md to HTML and PDF formats. They
    require Pandoc.

pandoctpl.latex
    a Pandoc template used by doPDFs.sh.

Finishing the installation in a TDS hierarchy:

-   move the style files to TDS:tex/generic/xint/

-   xint.dtx goes to TDS:source/generic/xint/

-   the documentation (xint.pdf, README.md,...) goes to
    TDS:doc/generic/xint/

Depending on the destination, it may then be necessary to refresh a
filename database.
